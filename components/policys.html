        <h2>Payment Policy</h2>
        <p>We aim to make the ordering process for your customizable photo frames as smooth as possible. Please read the following terms carefully before placing an order:</p>
    
        <h3>Accepted Payment Methods</h3>
        <p>We currently accept payments via UPI methods, including Google Pay and PhonePe. Details for payment will be shared during the order process on WhatsApp.</p>
    
        <h3>Payment Requirements</h3>
        <p>
            To confirm and start processing your order, full payment is required. Alternatively, you may choose to pay 50% of the total amount upfront to receive a design preview.  
            If you approve the design, the remaining 50% must be paid to proceed with production and dispatch.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Design Approval and Cancellations</h3>
        <p>
            If you decide to cancel the order after receiving the design preview, we will refund 50% of the upfront payment.  
            Once the design is approved and the remaining payment is made, the order will be processed, and no cancellations or refunds will be allowed.
        </p>
    
        <h3>No Refunds for Custom Orders</h3>
        <p>As all our products are customized to your specifications, refunds will not be issued after the final payment and once production has started.</p>
    
        <h3>Payment Confirmation</h3>
        <p>Please ensure you share proof of payment (such as a screenshot) with us on WhatsApp for faster processing of your order.</p>
    
        <p>By placing an order, you agree to the terms outlined in this payment policy. For any questions or concerns, feel free to contact us on WhatsApp.</p>

        <p>Thank you for choosing our customizable photo frames. Please note that as our products are specially made to your specifications, the following terms apply:</p>
    
        <h3>No Returns on Customized Products</h3>
        <p>
            All our products are custom-made based on your preferences and approval. Once the product is created and dispatched, returns are not accepted unless the product is damaged during delivery.
        </p>
    
        <h3>Damage During Delivery</h3>
        <p>
            If your product arrives damaged, please contact us within 48 hours of receiving it.

        <p>Upon verification, we will offer a replacement or refund based on the extent of the damage.</p>
    
        <h3>Order Cancellations</h3>

        </p>
    
        <h3>No Refunds for Approved Designs</h3>

        <h3>Customer Responsibility</h3>
        <p>
            Ensure that all customization details (e.g., photos, text, or special requests) are accurate when placing the order. We are not liable for errors in submitted details.
